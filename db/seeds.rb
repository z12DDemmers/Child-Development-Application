Subdomain.create(:subdomain => "Symbolic Play",:domain_id => "1",:subdomain_description => "Play is a vital part of a child's learning and development.  Play helps children learn to solve problems.  It also teaches them about the world around them.  At first play is focused on their own actions.  Babies are more interested in their own actions than their toys.  Eventually they begin to focus more on what they are playing with.  They will begin to examine their toys but rarely use them for their intended purpose.  Next, children begin to play with toys according to their true function.  After this stage children begin to pretend and have more complex interactions with their toys.  A child may have difficulty in this area if they have not had exposure to play activities, have a low motivation to play due to emotional stress, have sensory issues which cause them to interpret sights, sounds, touch, or movement differently, have a motor delay that would make it more difficult for them to play, or have a visual impairment that would prevent them from visually exploring their environment.  A severe delay may indicate difficulty with cognitive processing.")

Instead of shaking or squeezing toys they will usually want to look at them, hold them, and put them in their mouth.  They will most likely only be able to hold onto one toy at a time.  
To encourage them make sure to switch toys between their right and left hands.  You may need to try objects of different size, color, texture, pattern, and material to see what they are drawn to.  
You can also try to get them to hold objects in varies positions (sitting on your lap, laying on their back, laying on their side).  Once they have the toy in their grasp it is best to let them choose how they are going to explore it.  
If they need help place the toy in their hand and help them hold it.  Guide their arm toward the middle of their chest so they can see what they are holding.   
Babies should not use objects with small or bell shaped ends that can block their airways.  Squeakers in toys can break off and also block their airways.  The toys you offer should be big enough that they cannot fit through a paper towel roll.  If they can fit through they are a choking hazard.")

To encourage them give them access to household items they can play with.  For example, they might like pots, storage containers, big spoons, or plastic cups.  
You can also give them objects to play with that are related to what you are doing.  While you are brushing your hair you can give them a big comb and a doll.  While you are brushing your teeth you can give them a toothbrush and a doll.  While you are cooking you can give them a bowl and a big spoon.  
If they need help you can try to add in toys while they are playing.  For example, if they are playing with a baby you can place a spoon in their other hand and guide it up to the baby's mouth.   If they are banging a spoon on their tray you can place a small bowl on their tray and guide their hand to bang the spoon against it.  
If there are certain items that they continue to mouth or spin frequently instead of playing with them functionally you can remove those items and replace them with ones that are easier for them to play with.  For example, if they are only mouthing their toys you can offer them toys that are too big to fit in their mouth.  
When they bring a toy to their mouth you can gently stop the action and then move their hand to show them how to play with the toy (put the comb up to their hair or bang the spoon on the bowl).  Make sure to give them a lot of praise when they are playing with an object appropriately.")

By only responding to their cries during certain times of the day it provides them with mixed signals about their ability to depend upon you as a caregiver.  
Children at this stage do not have a firm grasp of cause and effect.  Therefore, they are not manipulating by crying.  They are just communicating an unmet need.  
This does not mean that a child will get everything that they want.  Sometimes the things they want are dangerous or they just can't have them.  In these cases they might cry when denied something.  It is not advisable to then give them what you originally denied them.  This can teach them manipulative behavior.

From there they develop control of the muscles along their back allowing them to lift up their head and chest.  Muscles along the front of the neck and tummy develop more gradually.  Therefore, it is easier for them to lift their head while on their tummy than it is while they are on their back.  Development of these muscles will help them remain steady when they sit later.  A baby may have difficulty in this area if they have not had enough tummy time, if they are extra sensitive to touch, if they have a visual impairment, or if they have a larger head.  A significant delay might indicate a neuro-motor or muscular-skeletal problem.")

Tummy time is placing the baby on a flat firm surface on their tummy while they are awake and supervised.  Place their arms out in front of them with their palms facing down.  Their elbows should be bent.  
Don't place babies on their tummy on soft pillows, bedding, bean bags, or soft cushions.  It is a suffocation risk.  Tummy time can be introduced gradually - one minute at a time.  However, it should be done several times per day. If your baby resists tummy time on the floor, try laying them on different textures or laying them on your chest while you are laying on your back or leaning back.  You can also try rubbing their back, singing and talking to them, or placing interesting things in front of them.  
To encourage them to turn their head from side to side you can place an interesting object that makes noise (your face or a rattle) to one side of their head.  Once it catches their attention, slowly move it to their other side and make noise with it.  
To encourage them to stay on their stomach you can gently massage your baby's back while they are laying on their stomach.  Wait at least an hour after your baby has eaten to massage them.
